// Debugging can be performed by setting the TF_LOG env variable 
// name to any value. Accepted values are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO,
// WARN, ERROR. TRACE is the default if nothing is set.

// If we don't want the log output to be printed on screen, we 
// can save the logs to a file. This can be done by setting the 
// env variable TF_LOG_PATH as export TF_LOG_PATH = path_to_log.
